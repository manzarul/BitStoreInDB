## BitStoreInDB
BitStore is a technique for storing multiple related values within a single database column. This approach allows you to store a composite value (using bit flags) and decode it back into meaningful information when you read it.

This guide demonstrates how to implement BitStore with examples in Java. You can adapt the approach to suit your specific use case
### Key Concepts
- Storing Multiple Values in One Column: Learn how to store bit flags in a database column.
- Decoding Stored Values: Understand how to retrieve and interpret multiple attributes from a single integer value stored in the database.
- Efficient Storage with Bit/Binary Values: Optimize database storage by using a single column to handle multiple boolean-like values.

### Example: Defining an Enum in Java
 The example illustrates how to define and use an enum for managing bit flags, which you can update as needed based on your use case.
